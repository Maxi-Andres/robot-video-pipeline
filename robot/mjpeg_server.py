mjpeg_server — a passthrough tee: serves the robot's JPEG frames over HTTP while forwarding
them, byte for byte, to whatever comes next in the pipe.

    go2_jpeg_stream | mjpeg_server.py | gst-launch-1.0 ... (H.264 -> RTMP -> NVR)
                           |
                           +-- HTTP /stream  -> AI-VL camera bridge, Splunk <img>, browsers

WHY: the live view must NOT travel through the recording chain. Reading the camera off DDS on
the same subnet used to be ~instant because the app got the JPEGs directly; routing the live
view through encode -> RTMP -> mediamtx -> Frigate -> MJPEG added ~7 s, because an NVR buffers
on purpose. This restores the short path with HTTP instead of DDS as the transport, so it
works with the robot on any network, and leaves the H.264/RTMP path untouched for recording —
where latency does not matter.

The recording branch CANNOT throttle the live branch. rtmpsink blocks when the uplink is
full, GStreamer then stops reading its stdin, the pipe fills, and a blocking write here used
to propagate that stall all the way back into the camera capture — measured, 14 fps of capture
collapsing to 5.9 because the NVR could not keep up. Frames for the NVR now go through a
bounded queue and the OLDEST is dropped when it overflows: the recorder degrades, nothing else
does.

Latency discipline, and it is the whole point of this file:
  * ONE frame of state. Only the newest JPEG is kept; there is no queue to fall behind in.
  * A slow client SKIPS frames instead of delaying everyone. Nothing is ever buffered for it.
  * Passthrough to stdout is byte-exact and never blocks on HTTP clients — the recording
    branch always gets the original 1080p bytes, whatever the live branch is doing.
  * By default nothing is decoded or re-encoded. Set MJPEG_WIDTH to trade a little Jetson
    CPU for much smaller frames, which is what a constrained link to the robot needs: the
    resize happens ONCE per frame, not once per viewer.

Standard library only (Python 3.8 on the robot).
