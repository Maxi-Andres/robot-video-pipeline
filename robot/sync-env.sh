# Add keys that exist in video.env.example but not in video.env, keeping every value you
# already set.
#
# WHY: video.env is gitignored on purpose — a `git pull` must never overwrite the address
# this robot reports to. The side effect is that new knobs added upstream only ever appear
# in the .example, so after a pull your video.env silently lacks them. They still work
# (run-video.sh has defaults) but they are invisible and untunable, which is worse than
# either extreme.

#   EXAMPLE=video.g1.env.example bash robot/sync-env.sh      # G1
#   sudo systemctl restart robot-video

# The G1 passes EXAMPLE=video.g1.env.example: its keys are the same, its values are not, and
# a key added from the Go2's example would bring the Go2's value with it.
