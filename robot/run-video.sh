# Robot-side video: capture from DDS, encode in HARDWARE, push out over SRT.
#
# Runs ON THE ROBOT (its high-level Jetson). This is the half of the pipeline that must be
# L2-adjacent to the robot's DDS — proven, not assumed: from another subnet the robot pings
# fine (1.3 ms) but only 2 of 122 DDS topics are visible. See robot-splunk-docs/RED-Y-DDS.md.
#
#   go2_jpeg_stream (DDS) -> mjpeg_server -> nvjpegdec -> nvv4l2h264enc -> flvmux -> rtmpsink
#                                  |
#                                  +-- HTTP :8093/stream  (the LOW-LATENCY live path)
#
# Two consumers, one reader. The Unitree videohub is request/response, so a second
# go2_jpeg_stream would steal half the frames — hence a passthrough tee instead.
#
# Why this shape:
#   * GStreamer, not ffmpeg: the Jetson has NO ffmpeg, but it does have gst-launch-1.0 and
#     nvv4l2h264enc, the Tegra HARDWARE H.264 encoder (/dev/nvhost-msenc). Hardware encode
#     costs almost no CPU and needs no binary shipped to the robot.
#   * RTMP, not RTSP: rtspclientsink is not installed on the robot.
#   * RTMP, not SRT — and this one was measured, not assumed. SRT would be the better
#     protocol for a lossy WAN link, but the robot ships **libsrt 1.4.0** (Ubuntu 20.04,
#     2020) and mediamtx's own Go SRT implementation REJECTS its handshake: the robot logs
#     "REJECT reported from HS processing" and mediamtx logs nothing at all. Bisected by
#     pointing the same pipeline at an ffmpeg/libsrt listener, where it connected fine — so
#     the incompatibility is libsrt-1.4.0 <-> mediamtx, not the robot or the network.
#     RTMP rides TCP, so retransmission covers packet loss at the cost of latency and of
#     head-of-line blocking. Revisit SRT if libsrt on the robot is ever updated: set
#     PROTO=srt below.
#
# Env:
#   NIC       robot-internal interface for DDS   (default eth0)
#   MAXFPS    cap the capture rate               (default 15 — bounds field bandwidth)
#   PUBLISH_HOST  where mediamtx listens        (required)
#   PROTO         rtmp (default) or srt          (srt needs a newer libsrt on the robot)
#   PUBLISH_PORT  1935 for rtmp, 8890 for srt    (default follows PROTO)
#   STREAM        mediamtx path to publish into  (default robot)
#   BITRATE       H.264 bitrate in bits/s        (default 2000000)
#   LATENCY       SRT latency budget in ms       (default 300; raise on satellite links)
#   WIDTH/HEIGHT  scale before encoding          (empty = native 1920x1080)
#   IDR_FRAMES    keyframe interval in frames    (default 15 = 1/s at 15fps; lower = faster
#                                                 join for a new viewer, more bitrate)
#   MJPEG_ENABLE  1 (default) = also serve the raw JPEGs over HTTP for the live view
#   MJPEG_PORT    HTTP port for that            (default 8093)
#   MJPEG_FPS     cap for HTTP viewers only     (0 = every frame; does not affect the NVR)
set -uo pipefail    # NOT -e: the supervision loop must survive child failures
